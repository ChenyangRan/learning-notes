'q' in qpos and qvel refer to the generalize coordinate. The order of q is also dependent on the joint id you specify in the .xml model. For the 'simulation.cpp' example, qpos[0]~qpos[6] corresponds to the 'root' joint cartesian position (qpos[0]~qpos[2]) and orientation (qpos[3]~qpos[6]), and qvel[0]~qvel[5] correspond to the 'root' joint velocity, translational (qvel[0]~qvel[2]) and rotational (qvel[3]~qvel[5]). Note that for orientation you follow the quaternion notation thus need four element but for velocity you use angular velocity which consists of 3 elements.
