from Hung-yi Lee

Meta learning = learn to learn

life-long learning: one model for all the tasks
Meta learning: How to learn a new model
few-shot learning: widely considered in few-show learning

Learning Algorithm: F: D -> T

Step 1: define a set of learning algorithm (Function F)

Step 2: Define the goodness fo a function F

$$L(F)=\sum{L^n}$$

find the best function

Step 3:
